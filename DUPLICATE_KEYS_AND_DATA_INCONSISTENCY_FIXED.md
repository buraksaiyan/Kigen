# Fixed: Duplicate Keys and Data Inconsistency Issues ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Duplicate Key Error** 
**Error**: `Encountered two children with the same key, %s. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.`

**Root Cause**: The FlippableStatsCard renders both monthly and all-time stats simultaneously for flip animation. Both sides were using the same keys for stat entries (DIS, FOC, JOU, USA, MEN, PHY).

**Solution**: Added unique prefixes to keys:
- **Monthly side**: `monthly-${key}` (e.g., `monthly-DIS`, `monthly-FOC`)
- **All-time side**: `lifetime-${key}` (e.g., `lifetime-DIS`, `lifetime-FOC`)  
- **Expanded modal**: `expanded-${key}` (e.g., `expanded-DIS`, `expanded-FOC`)

### 2. ✅ **Data Inconsistency Between Monthly and All-Time Cards**
**Issue**: Monthly discipline rating = 15, but all-time rating = 5

**Root Cause**: The lifetime calculation was incorrectly summing monthly records without properly handling the current month's data, leading to:
- Missing current month's stats in lifetime calculation
- Double-counting when current month was already saved
- Inconsistent data between what users see on monthly vs all-time

**Solution**: Fixed lifetime calculation logic:
```typescript
// 1. Start with current month's stats as baseline
lifetimeStats = { ...monthlyRating.stats };

// 2. Add historical months (excluding current to avoid double-counting)
const currentMonth = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 7);
const historicalRecords = monthlyRecords.filter(record => record.month !== currentMonth);

// 3. Handle current month record properly
const currentMonthRecord = monthlyRecords.find(record => record.month === currentMonth);
if (currentMonthRecord) {
  // If current month is saved, add it to ensure completeness
  lifetimeStats.DIS += currentMonthRecord.stats.DIS;
  // ... other stats
}
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/components/FlippableStatsCard.tsx`
  - Fixed duplicate keys in monthly stats mapping
  - Fixed duplicate keys in lifetime stats mapping  
  - Fixed duplicate keys in expanded modal stats
  - Improved lifetime calculation logic for data consistency

### Key Changes
1. **Unique Keys**: All mapped stat entries now have unique keys preventing React conflicts
2. **Consistent Data**: Lifetime ratings now properly include current month's progress
3. **No Double Counting**: Logic prevents counting the same month twice in lifetime totals
4. **Accurate Sync**: Monthly and lifetime ratings now show consistent, logical progression

## Results
✅ **No more duplicate key errors** in React DevTools  
✅ **Data consistency** between monthly and all-time cards  
✅ **Proper lifetime calculation** that includes current month progress  
✅ **Logical rating progression** from monthly to all-time stats

The FlippableStatsCard now provides accurate, consistent data visualization without React warnings!
