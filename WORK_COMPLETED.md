# Work Completed - Session Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Session Duration:** Comprehensive multi-issue fix session

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. Active Tracking Swipe Sections Redesign ‚úÖ
**Problem:** All swipeable items (goals, habits, todos, reminders) were grouped into ONE horizontal carousel, making navigation confusing.

**Solution:** Separated into 4 independent, vertically-stacked swipe sections:
- **Goals:** 1 goal per slide, horizontal swipe within section
- **Habits:** 1 habit per slide, horizontal swipe within section
- **Reminders:** 3 reminders per slide, horizontal swipe within section
- **ToDos:** 3 todos per slide, horizontal swipe within section
- **Usage Statistics:** At bottom

**File Modified:** `src/modules/dashboard/DashboardScreenNew.tsx`  
**Status:** WORKING ‚úÖ

---

### 2. Animated Streak Button with Glow ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Animation claimed to be complete but wasn't working - no visible glow effect.

**Solution:** Implemented cross-platform pulsing glow animation:
- Static white circle outline (2px border)
- Animated glow layer using opacity interpolation (0.3 ‚Üí 0.8)
- 2-second pulse loop (fade in/out)
- Platform-specific glow:
  - **Android:** Elevation for depth
  - **iOS:** Shadow for glow effect

**File Modified:** `src/components/BottomBar/index.tsx`  
**Status:** WORKING ‚úÖ

---

### 3. App Streak Logic Verification ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Concern that streak calculation might not be working correctly.

**Solution:** Verified existing implementation is correct:
- Requirements: **1 journal entry + 30 min completed focus session**
- Maximum **+1 per day**
- **Resets to 0** if any day is skipped
- Logic in `getDailyStreak()` function is accurate

**File Verified:** `src/services/userStatsService.ts`  
**Status:** CORRECT ‚úÖ

---

### 4. Android Notification Icon ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Notifications don't have an icon on Android.

**Solution:** Configuration is already present in `app.json`:
```json
"expo-notifications": {
  "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
  "color": "#14B8A6"
}
```

**Note:** Icon will display properly in production/development builds via EAS. Expo Go might not show custom notification icons.

**File:** `app.json` (lines 21-26)  
**Status:** CONFIGURED ‚úÖ (needs EAS build to test)

---

### 5. Focus Completion Screen Created ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Focus sessions show Alert dialog instead of proper full-screen completion UI.

**Solution:** Created `FocusCompletionScreen.tsx` with:
- Full-screen gradient background (themed to focus mode color)
- Success icon with themed background circle
- Session name display
- Duration summary with icon
- Session type badge
- Motivational text
- Two action buttons:
  - **"Start Another Session"** ‚Üí Returns to focus modes
  - **"Go to Dashboard"** ‚Üí Navigates to dashboard

**File Created:** `src/screens/FocusCompletionScreen.tsx` (NEW)  
**Status:** CREATED ‚úÖ (needs integration - see IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
