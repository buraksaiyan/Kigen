# All 9 Testing Bugs Fixed - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary
All 9 bugs identified during testing have been successfully fixed. This document provides a complete overview of each issue and its resolution.

---

## 1. âœ… App Not Visible in Android Usage Access Settings

**Issue**: The app was not appearing in the Android usage access permission granting page.

**Root Cause**: Missing `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` permission declaration in `app.json`.

**Fix**: Added the required permission to the Android permissions array.

**File Modified**: `app.json`
```json
"permissions": [
  "android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
  "android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE",
  "android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS"
]
```

## 2. âœ… "I Already Granted It" Button Creates Mock Data

**Issue**: The "I Already Granted It" button in permission dialogs was creating mock data, which is poor UX and pollutes real data.

**Root Cause**: Permission dialogs had fallback logic that generated fake usage data when users claimed to have granted permission.

**Fix**: Removed both instances of the "I Already Granted It" button from Alert dialogs in `nativeUsageTracker.ts`.

**File Modified**: `src/services/nativeUsageTracker.ts`
- Removed button from first Alert.alert (lines 107-120)
- Removed button from second Alert.alert (lines 125-140)
- Also changed "Expo Go" references to "InZone" for better branding

---

## 3. âœ… Remove Mock Data from Leaderboards

**Issue**: Leaderboard screen was showing mock data instead of real user data.

**Root Cause**: `LeaderboardService.ts` had `getMockGlobalLeaderboard()` function as a fallback that generated fake leaderboard entries.

**Fix**: 
- Removed `getMockGlobalLeaderboard()` function entirely
- Changed error fallback to return empty array or cached data only
- Fixed TypeScript type annotations to ensure proper LeaderboardEntry[] handling

**File Modified**: `src/services/LeaderboardService.ts`
- Deleted getMockGlobalLeaderboard() function (lines 229-243)
- Updated error handling to return `[]` or cached data instead of mock data

---

## 4. âœ… Remove "Improve Focus" Button from Usage Section

**Issue**: The "Improve Focus" button in the usage section was unused and created UI clutter.

**Root Cause**: Legacy UI element that was no longer needed.

**Fix**: Removed the TouchableOpacity wrapper containing the "Improve Focus" button.

**File Modified**: `src/modules/dashboard/DashboardScreenNew.tsx`
- Removed button and its wrapper (lines 1392-1395)

---

## 5. âœ… Remove "Dashboard Overview" Box from Dashboard Settings

**Issue**: The "Dashboard Overview" box in dashboard settings was taking up space without providing value.

**Root Cause**: Unnecessary UI element in the customization screen.

**Fix**: Made the `renderUsageStats()` function return `null` to hide the entire overview section.

**File Modified**: `src/screens/DashboardCustomizationScreen.tsx`
- Replaced entire renderUsageStats() function body to return null (lines 256-275)

---

## 6. âœ… Fix "Close" Button Text Overflow

**Issue**: The "Close" button text was wrapping, with "Clos" on one line and "e" on the next line.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient space and no text wrapping prevention in the button style.

**Fix**: Added `flexShrink: 0` and `minWidth: 50` to the closeButtonText style to prevent text wrapping.

**File Modified**: `src/screens/DashboardCustomizationScreen.tsx`
```typescript
closeButtonText: {
  color: '#FFFFFF',
  fontSize: 16,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  flexShrink: 0,    // NEW: Prevents text from shrinking
  minWidth: 50,     // NEW: Ensures minimum width for text
}
```

---

## 7. âœ… Sign In Button Not Navigating to Sign In Page

**Issue**: Clicking the sign in button in the sidebar was not navigating to the sign in page.

**Root Cause**: LoginScreen modal was not being rendered in the navigation tree, even though the visibility state was being managed in AuthProvider.

**Fix**: Added LoginScreen modal rendering to MainNavigator with proper visibility control.

**File Modified**: `src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`
- Added LoginScreen import
- Added useAuth hook import and usage
- Added conditional LoginScreen modal rendering
- Renamed theme to appTheme to avoid variable name conflict

```typescript
const { isLoginScreenVisible, hideLoginScreen } = useAuth();

// Render LoginScreen modal when visible
{isLoginScreenVisible && (
  <LoginScreen 
    onClose={hideLoginScreen} 
    theme={appTheme} 
  />
)}
```

---

## 8. âœ… Past Journals Show Duplicate Titles

**Issue**: When expanding past journal entries, the title was shown twice - once as the title and once at the beginning of the body text.

**Root Cause**: The body text was showing the full `entry.content` which includes the first line (the title), while the title was also separately displayed using `entry.content.split('\n')[0]`.

**Fix**: Modified the body text display to exclude the first line.

**File Modified**: `src/screens/JournalViewScreen.tsx`
```typescript
// OLD: Shows entire content including title
{entry.content}

// NEW: Excludes first line (title) from body
{entry.content.split('\n').slice(1).join('\n') || entry.content}
```

## 9. âœ… DET Awards for Achievement Completion Not Being Granted

**Issue**: When achievements were unlocked, the promised +5 DET points per achievement were not being awarded.

**Root Cause**: The `achievementService.unlockAchievement()` method was unlocking achievements and showing notifications, but was not triggering the DET points award. The rating system's `calculateDeterminationPoints()` function included achievement bonuses in its calculation, but points were only calculated based on total count, not granted at unlock time.

**Fix**: 
1. Created `grantAchievementDETBonus()` method in UserStatsService that:
   - Awards +5 DET points per achievement
   - Records points in PointsHistoryService with metadata
   - Updates monthly stats
   - Syncs with leaderboard

2. Modified `unlockAchievement()` to call the new bonus method immediately after unlocking

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/services/userStatsService.ts` - Added grantAchievementDETBonus() method
- `src/services/achievementService.ts` - Added DET bonus call in unlockAchievement()

**Rating System Rules** (from `ratingSystem.ts`):
```typescript
// Per Achievement unlock -> +5 Points
points += achievementsUnlocked * 5;
```
