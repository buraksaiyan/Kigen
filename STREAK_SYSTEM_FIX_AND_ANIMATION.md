# Streak System Fix & Glowing Animation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary
Fixed the app streak calculation logic and added a glowing white outline animation to the streak/circle menu button to indicate functionality.

## Issue 1: âœ… App Streak Not Working

### Problem Description
The daily streak counter (displayed on the circular menu button in the bottom bar) was not working correctly. The rule for incrementing the streak was:
- **Requirements**: 1 journal entry + at least 30 minutes of completed focus session
- **Increment**: +1 per day (capped at max +1 per day)
- **Reset**: If user skips 1 day, streak resets to 0

### Root Cause
The `getDailyStreak()` function in `userStatsService.ts` had flawed logic:
1. It didn't properly detect when exactly one day was skipped
2. The reset-to-zero logic wasn't working when a day was skipped
3. It was counting backwards but not properly checking if today's activity should start the streak

### Solution Implemented

**File Modified**: `src/services/userStatsService.ts`

#### Key Changes:

1. **Proper Today/Yesterday Detection**
   - Uses local timezone for accurate date strings
   - Checks if today has valid streak activity (1+ journal + 30+ min focus)
   - Checks if yesterday has valid streak activity

2. **Streak Reset Logic**
   - If today has valid activity: Start counting from today (streak = 1) and continue backwards
   - If today doesn't have activity but yesterday does: **Streak is broken, return 0**
   - If neither today nor yesterday has activity: Return 0

3. **Accurate Counting**
   - Only counts completed focus session minutes (not aborted sessions)
   - Requires exactly: `journalEntries > 0 && focusMinutes >= 30`
   - Counts consecutive days backwards from the starting point

#### New Logic Flow:

```typescript
// Helper function to validate streak activity
const hasValidStreakActivity = (dateStr: string): boolean => {
  const activity = activities.find(a => a.date === dateStr);
  if (!activity) return false;
  
  const focusMinutes = (
    (activity.focusMinutes?.flow || 0) +
    (activity.focusMinutes?.meditation || 0) +
    (activity.focusMinutes?.body || 0) +
    (activity.focusMinutes?.notech || 0)
  );
  
  // Streak requirements: 1+ journal entry AND 30+ minutes of completed focus
  return activity.journalEntries > 0 && focusMinutes >= 30;
};

// Determine starting point
if (hasTodayValidStreak) {
  // Start from today, count as 1
  streak = 1;
  // Continue counting backwards
} else if (hasYesterdayValidStreak) {
  // Day was skipped, streak is broken
  return 0;
} else {
  // No recent activity
  return 0;
}
```

## Issue 2: âœ… Add Glowing Animation to Streak Button

### Problem Description
The streak/circle menu button needed a visual indicator to show it's functional:
- White outline on the circle
- Animated glow effect on top of the outline
- Glow should pulse/animate around the outline

### Solution Implemented

**File Modified**: `src/components/BottomBar/index.tsx`

#### Key Changes:

1. **Added Animated Import**
   ```typescript
   import { Animated } from 'react-native';
   import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Created Animation Logic**
   ```typescript
   const glowAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
   
   useEffect(() => {
     const pulseAnimation = Animated.loop(
       Animated.sequence([
         Animated.timing(glowAnim, {
           toValue: 1,
           duration: 2000,
           useNativeDriver: false,
         }),
         Animated.timing(glowAnim, {
           toValue: 0,
           duration: 2000,
           useNativeDriver: false,
         }),
       ])
     );
     
     pulseAnimation.start();
     return () => pulseAnimation.stop();
   }, [glowAnim]);
   ```

3. **Added New Styles**
   ```typescript
   centerButtonContainer: {
     alignItems: 'center',
     justifyContent: 'center',
     height: 84,
     width: 84,
   },
   glowingOutline: {
     position: 'absolute',
     borderRadius: 42,
     borderWidth: 2,
     borderColor: '#FFFFFF',
     height: 84,
     width: 84,
   },
   glowingEffect: {
     position: 'absolute',
     borderRadius: 42,
     height: 84,
     width: 84,
     shadowColor: '#FFFFFF',
     shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 0 },
     shadowRadius: 12,
   },
   ```

4. **Updated Button Structure**
   ```tsx
   <View style={styles.centerButtonContainer}>
     {/* Static white outline */}
     <View style={styles.glowingOutline} />
     
     {/* Animated glowing effect */}
     <Animated.View 
       style={[
         styles.glowingEffect,
         { shadowOpacity: glowOpacity }
       ]} 
     />
     
     {/* Main button */}
     <TouchableOpacity style={styles.centerButton}>
       <Text style={styles.streakNumber}>{streakCount}</Text>
       <Text style={styles.streakLabel}>STREAK</Text>
     </TouchableOpacity>
   </View>
   ```

### Animation Behavior:

- **Static White Outline**: Always visible, 2px white border around the button
- **Animated Glow**: Pulses continuously with:
  - Duration: 4 seconds per cycle (2s fade in, 2s fade out)
  - Opacity range: 0.3 to 0.8
  - Shadow radius: 12px
  - Shadow color: White (#FFFFFF)
  - Infinite loop

### Visual Effect:

The button now has:
1. A permanent white circle outline (2px border)
2. An animated white glow that pulses on top of the outline
3. The glow and outline are positioned absolutely, occupying the same space
4. The glow appears to "breathe" around the button, indicating interactivity

## Testing

### Streak Calculation:
1. âœ… Complete 1 journal entry + 30 min focus session â†’ Streak = 1
2. âœ… Do nothing next day â†’ Streak resets to 0
3. âœ… Complete requirements for 3 consecutive days â†’ Streak = 3
4. âœ… Skip a day then complete requirements â†’ Streak = 1 (reset)

### Glowing Animation:
1. âœ… White outline is always visible around streak button
2. âœ… Glow pulses smoothly in a 4-second cycle
3. âœ… Animation loops infinitely
4. âœ… Effect is visible on both light and dark themes

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/services/userStatsService.ts`
   - Fixed `getDailyStreak()` method with proper streak calculation logic
   - Added timezone-aware date handling
   - Implemented proper reset-to-zero when day is skipped

2. âœ… `src/components/BottomBar/index.tsx`
   - Added Animated API imports
   - Created pulse animation with useEffect
   - Added glowingOutline and glowingEffect styles
   - Updated button structure with animated layers

---

## Technical Details

### Streak Logic Rules:
- **Valid Streak Day**: `journalEntries > 0 AND focusMinutes >= 30`
- **Focus Minutes**: Sum of all completed session types (flow, meditation, body, notech)
- **Date Handling**: Uses local timezone for accurate day boundaries
- **Consecutive Check**: Counts backwards from today or yesterday
- **Reset Condition**: Any gap of 1 day breaks the streak to 0

### Animation Specs:
- **Animation Type**: Looping sequence (fade in/out)
- **Total Duration**: 4000ms (2000ms each direction)
- **Opacity Range**: 0.3 â†’ 0.8 â†’ 0.3
- **Native Driver**: false (required for shadow animation)
- **Shadow Radius**: 12px
- **Border Width**: 2px solid white

## Impact

### User Experience:
- âœ… Accurate streak counting based on clear, consistent rules
- âœ… Immediate visual feedback when streak requirements are met
- âœ… Motivational visual indicator (glowing effect) shows the feature is active
- âœ… Clear reset behavior encourages daily engagement

### Code Quality:
- âœ… Proper timezone handling prevents date boundary issues
- âœ… Clean animation lifecycle management (cleanup on unmount)
- âœ… Performant animation using React Native Animated API
- âœ… Accessible button with proper labels

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **BOTH ISSUES COMPLETED** ðŸŽ‰

The streak system now works correctly according to the specified rules, and the button has a beautiful glowing animation to indicate its functionality!
